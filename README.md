AdaBoost Model
Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) algorithm, a powerful ensemble technique that combines multiple weak classifiers to form a strong classifier. AdaBoost is particularly effective for binary classification problems and has been widely used in various applications such as face detection, biology, and computer vision.

Features
Adaptive Learning: Implements the AdaBoost algorithm which focuses on misclassified instances, improving the model iteratively.
Versatility: Can be used with any learning algorithm, provided it accepts weights on the training set.
Model Evaluation: Includes scripts for evaluating the modelâ€™s performance with metrics like accuracy, ROC AUC, and confusion matrix.
Visualization: Provides tools for visualizing the decision boundaries created by the AdaBoost model.

Example Usage:
Python

from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Load your dataset
# X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = ...

base_estimator = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1)
model = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=base_estimator, n_estimators=50)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Customization
Base Estimator: Choose a base estimator that is best suited for your data. Decision trees are commonly used, but any algorithm can be used as the weak learner.
Hyperparameters: Fine-tune n_estimators, learning_rate, and the parameters of your base estimator to optimize performance.
